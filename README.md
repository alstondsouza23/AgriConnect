The Agriculture Yield Predictor is a comprehensive full-stack web application that harnesses machine learning to revolutionize crop yield estimation for modern farming.
Built with React frontend featuring glass morphism design and animated components, Flask backend API, and scikit-learn ML algorithms, this project enables farmers to predict 
yields for seven major crops (wheat, rice, corn, barley, soybean, potato, tomato) with 89%+ accuracy based on environmental parameters like temperature, rainfall, humidity, soil pH, 
and fertilizer usage. The system features an intuitive prediction form, real-time yield calculations, responsive design across devices, and a complete RESTful API for seamless integration.
Developed by a team of three developers focusing on frontend UI/UX, backend ML implementation, and component architecture, this project bridges the gap between traditional agriculture and modern AI technology,
providing farmers with actionable insights for better crop planning, resource allocation, and risk management while supporting sustainable farming practices through data-driven decision making.
